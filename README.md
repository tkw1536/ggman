# ggman

![CI Status](https://github.com/tkw1536/ggman/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

A golang tool that can manage all your git repositories. 

## What Is ggman?

When you only have a couple of git repositories that you work on it is perfectly feasible to manage them by using `git clone`, `git pull` and friends. 
However once the number of repositories grows beyond a small number this can become tedious:

- It is hard to find which folder a repository has been cloned to
- Getting an overview of what is cloned and what is not is hard
- It's not easily possible to perform actions on more than one repo at once, e.g. `git pull`

This is the problem `ggman` is designed to solve. 
It allows one to:

- Maintain and expand a local directory structure of multiple repositories
- Run actions (such as `git clone`, `git pull`) on groups of repositories

## Why ggman?

While similar tools exist these commonly have a lot of downsides:

- they enforce a flat directory structure;
- they are limited to one repository provider (such as GitHub or GitLab); or
- they are only available from within an IDE or GUI.

ggman considers these as major downsides. 
The goals and principles of ggman are:

- to be command-line first;
- to be simple to install, configure and use;
- to encourage an obvious hierarchical directory structure, but remain fully functional with any directory structure;
- to remain free of provider-specific code; and
- to not store any repository-specific data outside of the repositories themselves (enabling the user to switch back to only git at any point).

## Setting up and using 'ggman'

Setting up ggman consists of two steps:

1. Getting the 'ggman' binary
2. Configuring the installation

### getting the `ggman` binary

There are two primary options for getting and installing ggman. 


#### Download a pre-built binary. 
You can download a pre-built binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/tkw1536/ggman/releases/latest) on GitHub. 
This page includes releases for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. 
Afterwards simply place it somewhere in your `$PATH`.

#### Install from Source

If you do not trust pre-built binaries you can build `ggman` from source. 
You need [`go`](https://golang.org) (version `1.18` or newer) along with `make` installed on your machine. 
After cloning this repository, you can simply type `make install` to have ggman installed automatically 

#### Optional Dependencies

The compiled `ggman` binary does not depend on any external software. 
However having `git` in `$PATH` allows for more efficient operations in some cases. 

Furthermore, if you have a custom `.ssh/config` on your system, the `git`-less setup may not be fully supported.
You should install a native `git` executable on your system.

To check if a running ggman installation has found a `git` executable, run `ggman env --raw git`.
If one is found, it will print the path to it.
### configuring `ggman`

ggman is easy to configure. 

It manages all git repositories inside a given root directory, and automatically sets up new repositories relative to the URLs they are cloned from. 
This root folder defaults to `~/Projects` but can be customized using the `$GGROOT` environment variable. 

Once the GGROOT environment variable is set, ggman is ready to be used. 

### first steps

To validate that the configuration is correct, you can list all repositories that ggman detects.
To do this type:

```
ggman ls
```

If you want to find a specific installed repository you can provide a `--for` argument.
For example:

```
ggman --for https://github.com/tkw1536/ggman ls
```

will print the location of a particular repository.

To clone a new repository into the root directory, you can use the `ggman clone` command.
For example:

```
ggman clone https://github.com/tkw1536/ggman
```

This will clone the repository https://github.com/tkw1536/ggman to the folder `$GGROOT/github.com/tkw1536/ggman` using ssh keys. 

If you want to move all existing repositories into the standardized structure you can use:

```
ggman relocate
```

If you want to only see what would be moved where you can instead use

```
ggman relocate --simulate
```

A more thorough documentation on the commands above and how the URL to path mapping works can be found in the thorough documentation below. 

### Optional: Additional shell aliases

In addition to ggman (described in detail below) certain aliases can also be very useful. 
They can be installed into your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` by adding the following line:

```bash
eval "$(ggman shellrc)"
```

#### ggcd

`ggcd` allows 'cd'-ing into a directory given a repository name.
For example, `ggcd github.com/hello/world` will cd into the directory where the `github.com/hello/world` repository is checked out. 
This also works with any pattern matching a repository, e.g. `ggcd world` will cd into the first repository matching `world`.

#### ggclone

`ggclone` behaves similar to `ggman clone` and `ggcd`.
It takes the exact same arguments as `ggman clone`, but when the repository already exists in the default location does not clone it again.
Furthermore, after finishing the clone, automatically `cd`s into the cloned repository.

#### ggcode

ggcode is like ggcd, except it opens an editor (here vscode) instead of cding.

## the `ggman` command

The `ggman` command is implemented in golang and can be compiled using standard golang tools. 
In addition, a `Makefile` is provided. 

The command is split into several sub-commands, which are described below. 
`ggman` has the following general exit behavior:

| Exit Code          | Description                                                           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0                  | Everything went ok                                                    |
| 1                  | Command Parsing went ok, but a subcommand-specific error occurred     |
| 2                  | The user asked for an unknown subcommand                              |
| 3                  | Command-independent argument parsing failed, e.g. an invalid '--for'  |
| 4                  | Command-dependent argument parsing failed                             |
| 5                  | Invalid configuration                                                 |
| 6                  | Unable to parse a repository name                                     |


### 'ggman root' and 'ggman where'

It manages all git repositories inside a given root directory, and automatically sets up new repositories relative to the URLs they are cloned from. 
The root folder defaults to `~/Projects` but can be customized using the `$GGROOT` environment variable. 
The root directory can be echoed using the command alias `ggman root`. 

For example, when `ggman` clones a repository `https://github.com/hello/world.git`, this would automatically end up in `$GGROOT/github.com/hello/world`. 
This works not only for `github.com` urls, but for any kind of url. 
To see where a repository would be cloned to (but not actually cloning it), use `ggman where <REPO>`. 

As of `ggman 1.12`, this translation of URLs into paths takes existing paths into account.
In particular, it re-uses existing sub-paths if they differ from the requested path only by casing.

For example, say the directory `$GGROOT/github.com/hello` exist and the user requests to clone `https://github.com/HELLO/world.git`.
Before 1.12, this clone would end up in `$GGROOT/github.com/HELLO/world`, resulting in two directories `$GGROOT/github.com/HELLO` and `$GGROOT/github.com/hello`. 
After 1.12, this clone will end up in `$GGROOT/github.com/hello/world`.
While this means placing of repositories needs to touch the disk (and check for existing directories), it results in less directory clutter.

By default, the first matching directory (in alphanumerical order) is used as opposed to creating a new one.
If a directory with the exact name exists, this is prefered over a case-insensitive match.

This normalization behavior can be controlled using the `GGNORM` environment variable.
It has three values:
- `smart` (use first matching path, prefer exact matches, default behavior);
- `fold` (fold paths, but do not prefer exact matches); and
- `none` (always use exact paths, legacy behavior)

### 'ggman ls'

While creating this folder structure when cloning new repositories, `ggman` can run operation on any other folder structure contained within the `GGROOT` directory. 
For this purpose the `ggman ls` command lists all repositories that have been found in this structure. 

For easier integration into scripts, `ggman ls` supports an `--exit-code` argument. 
If this is given, the command will return exit code 0 iff at least one repository is found, and exit code 1 otherwise. 

### the '--for', '--here' and '--path' arguments

When running multi-repository operations, it is possible to limit the operations to a specific subset of repositories. 
This is achieved by using the 'for' keyword along with a pattern. 
For example, `ggman --for 'github.com/*/example' ls` will list all repositories from `github.com` that are named `example`. 

Examples for supported patterns can be found in this table:

| Pattern            | Examples                                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `world`            | `git@github.com:hello/world.git`, `https://github.com/hello/world`  |*
| `hello/*`          | `git@github.com:hello/earth.git`, `git@github.com:hello/mars.git`   |
| `hello/m*`         | `git@github.com:hello/mars.git`, `git@github.com:hello/mercury.git` |
| `github.com/*/*`   | `git@github.com:hello/world.git`, `git@github.com:bye/world.git`    |
| `github.com/hello` | `git@github.com:hello/world.git`, `git@github.com:hello/mars.git`   |

Note that the `--for` argument also works for exact repository urls, e.g. `ggman --for 'https://github.com/tkw1536/GitManager' ls`. 
`--for` also works with absolute or relative filepaths to locally installed repositories. 

In addition, the `--for` argument by default uses a fuzzy matching algorithm.
For example, the pattern `wrld` will also match a repository called `world`.
Fuzzy matching only works for patterns that do not contain a special glob characters (`*` and friends).
It is also possible to turn off fuzzy matching entirely by passing the `--no-fuzzy-filter` / `-n` argument.

In addition to the `--for` argument, you can also use the `--path` argument.
Instead of taking a pattern, it takes a (relative or absolute) filesystem path and matches all repositories under it.
This also works when not inside `GGROOT`.
The `--path` argument can be provided multiple times.

The `--here` argument is an alias for `--path .`, meaning it matches only the repository located in the current working directory, or repositories under it. 

### 'ggman comps' and 'ggman canon'

On `github.com` and multiple other providers, it is usually possible to clone repositories via multiple urls. 
For example, the repository `https://github.com/hello/world` can actually be cloned via:
- `https://github.com/hello/world.git` and
- `git@github.com:hello/world.git`

Usually the latter url is preferred over the former one in order to use SSH authentication instead of having to constantly having to type a password. 
For this purpose, ggman implements the concept of `canonical urls`, that is it treats the latter url as the main one and uses it to clone the repository. 
This behavior can be customized by the user. 

A canonical url is generated from an original url using a so-called `CANSPEC` (canonical specification).
An example CANSPEC is `git@^:$.git`. 

CANSPECs generate canonical urls by first taking the original urls, and splitting them into path-like components. 
These components also perform some normalisation, such as removing common prefixes and suffixes. 
A few examples examples can be found in this table. 

| URL                            | Components                       |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `git@github.com/user/repo`     | `github.com`, `user`, `repo`     |
| `github.com/hello/world.git`   | `github.com`, `hello`, `world`   |
| `user@server.com:repo.git`     | `server.com`, `user`, `repo`     |

To see exactly which components a URL has, use `ggman comps <URL>`.

After this, the canonical url is generated by parsing each character of the CANSPEC.
By default, a character of the CANSPEC simply ends up in the canonical url. 
However, two characters are treated differently:
- `%` is replaced by the second unused component of the URI (commonly a username)
- `$` is replaced by all remaining components in the URI joined with a '/'. Also stops all special character processing afterwards. 
If `$` does not exist in the cspec, it is assumed to be at the end of the CANSPEC.

A couple of examples can be found below:

| CANSPEC           | Canonical URL of the components `server.com`, `user`, `repository` |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `git@^:$.git`     | `git@server.com:user/repository.git`                               |
| `ssh://%@^/$.git` | `ssh://user@server.com/repository.git`                             |
| (empty)           | `server.com/user/repository`                                       |

To get the canonical url of a repository use `ggman canon <URL> <CANSPEC>`. 

To customize the behaviour globally, a so-called `CANFILE` can be used. 
This `CANFILE` should either be called `.ggman` in the users home directory, or be pointed to by the `GGMAN_CANFILE` environment variable. 

A `CANFILE` should consist of several lines.
Each line should contain either one or two space-seperated strings. 
The first one is a pattern (as used with the `for` keyword) and the second is a CANSPEC to apply for all repositories matching this pattern. 
Empty lines and those starting with '#', '\\' are treated as comments. 

To resolve a canonical url with a CANFILE, simply omit the `CANSPEC` attribute of `ggman canon`. 

### 'ggman fix'

To fix an existing remote of a repository use `ggman fix`. 
This updates remotes of all matching repositories to their canonical form using the `CANFILE`. 
Optionally, you can pass a `--simulate` argument to `ggman fix`. 
Instead of storing any urls, it will only print what is being done to STDOUT. 

### 'ggman lsr'

To list the remotes of all installed repositories, use `ggman lsr`. 
It takes an optional argument `--canonical` which, if provided, cause ggman to print canonical urls instead of the provided ones. 

### 'ggman fetch' and 'ggman pull'

To fetch data for all repositories, or to run git pull, use `ggman fetch` and `ggman pull` respectively. 

### 'ggman clone', 'ggman link' and `ggman relocate`

To clone a new repository into the respective location, use `ggman clone` with the name of the repository as the argument, for example:

```bash
ggman clone git@github.com:hello/world.git
```

which will clone the the hello world repository into  `$GGROOT/github.com/hello/world`. 
This clonening not only works for the canonical repository url, but for any other url as well. 
For example:

```bash
ggman clone https://github.com/hello/world.git
```

will do the same as the above command. 

However sometimes for various reasons a repository needs to live in a non-standard location outside of `GGROOT`. 
For example, in the case of `go` packages these need to live within `$GOPATH`. 
In this case, it is sometimes useful to symlink these repositories into the existing directory structure. 
For this purpose, the `ggman link` command exists. 
This takes the path to the local clone of an existing repository, which will then be linked into the existing structure. 
For example

```bash
ggman link $HOME/go/src/github.com/hello/world
```

would link the repository in `$HOME/go/src/github.com/hello/world` into the right location. 
Here, this corresponds to `$GGROOT/github.com/hello/world`. 

Furthermore, sometimes a repository changes it's remote url and should be moved to the correct location. 
For this purpose the `ggman relocate` command can be used. 
It is called without arguments. 

### `ggman here`, `ggman web` and `ggman url`

```bash
ggman here
```
prints the current ggman-controlled repository. 
In addition, the command takes an optional `--tree` argument. 
When provided, also prints the location relative to the current git worktree root. 

Similarly, 

```bash
ggman web
```
attempts to open the url of the current repository in a web-browser. 
For this purpose it uses the CANSPEC `https://^/$`, which may not work with all git hosts. 
It also takes an optional `--tree`, which behaves similar and above and optionally opens a url pointing to the current folder. 

```bash
ggman url
```
is the same as `ggman web`, except that it only prints the URL to stdout. 

`ggman web` and `ggman url` also take an optional base url. 
If it is provided, the first component of the url is replace with the given base. 
ggman also supports a number of "default" base urls. 

For example:

```
ggman web godoc
```

will open the current repo on [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev). 
To see a list of supported default urls, use `ggman web --list-bases`.

### 'ggman find-branch'

git 2.28 introduced the `init.defaultBranch` option to set the name of the default branch of new repositories. 
However this does not affect existing repositories. 

To find repositories with an old branch, the `ggman find-branch` command can be used. 
It takes a single argument (a branch name), and finds all repositories that contain a branch with the given name. 

### 'ggman sweep'

After moving repositories around (for example using `ggman relocate`, or by manual operations) empty directories are often left behind. 
Because of the nature of ggman sometimes directories containing only empty directories may also be left behind. 
To easily find these directories, the `ggman sweep` command can be used. 

It takes no arguments, and lists all directories, which are not git repositories and are empty, or contain only empty directories.
These are listed in such an order that they can be deleted in order using `rmdir` and friends.

### 'ggman exec'

Sometimes it is useful to run an arbitrary command over all the known git repositories.
This can be achieved using the `ggman exec` command.
It simply takes a command as an argument and runs it in each repository.

### 'ggman env'

To debug and inspect the current environment of the ggman command the `ggman env` command can be used.
The environment exposed consists of a set of variables representing the state.
Use `ggman env --list` to see a list of variables.
Use `ggman env --describe` to see their corresponding human-readable descriptions.
Use `ggman env --raw` to print the raw values of these variables in the same order.
Use `ggman env` without any arguments to print escaped (variable, value) pairs.

You can also provide a list of variables as arguments to list only those variables.
For instance: `ggman env --raw GGROOT` will print the unescaped, raw value of the GGROOT environment variable.
Variables are matched case-insensitive.

### Command Aliases

ggman comes with the following builtin aliases:

- `ggman git` behaves exactly like `ggman exec git`
- `ggman require` behaves exactly like `ggman clone --force`
- `ggman root` behaves exactly like `ggman env --raw GGROOT` (for backwards compatibility)
