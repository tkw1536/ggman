# ggman

![CI Status](https://github.com/tkw1536/ggman/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

A golang tool that can manage all your git repositories. 
Originally a rewrite of [GitManager](https://github.com/tkw1536/GitManager), but has diverged. 

## Why ggman?

When you only have a couple of git repositories that you work on it is perfectly feasible to manage them by using `git clone`, `git pull` and friends. 
However once the number of repositories grows beyond a small number this can become tedious:

- It is hard to find which folder a repository has been cloned to
- Getting an overview of what is cloned and what is not is hard
- It's not easily possible to perform actions on more than one repos at once, e.g. `git pull`

This is the problem `ggman` is designed to solve. 
It allows one to:

- Maintain and expand a local directory structure of multiple repositories
- Run actions (such as `git clone`, `git pull`) on groups of repositories


## Setting up and using 'ggman'

Setting up ggman consists of two steps:

1. Getting the 'ggman' binary
2. Configuring the installation

### getting the `ggman` binary

There are two primary options for getting and installing ggman. 


#### Download a pre-built binary. 
You can download a pre-built binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/tkw1536/ggman/releases/latest) on GitHub. 
This page includes releases for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. 
Afterwards simply place it somewhere in your `$PATH`.

#### Install from Source

If you do not trust pre-built binaries you can build `ggman` from source. 
You need [`go`](https://golang.org) along with `make` installed on your machine. This project is tested on go `1.16`, older releasees may or may not work. 

After cloning this repository, you can then simply type `make` and executables will be generated inside the `dist/` directory. 

You can then either manually place them in your `$PATH`, or type `make install` to have it installed directly. 

#### Optional Dependencies

The compiled `ggman` binary does not depend on any external software. Nonetheless, having`git` in `$PATH` allows for more efficient operations in some cases. 

### configuring `ggman`

ggman is easy to configure. 

It manages all git repositories inside a given root directory, and automatically sets up new repositories relative to the URLs they are cloned from. 
This root folder defaults to `~/Projects` but can be customized using the `$GGROOT` environment variable. 

Once the GGROOT environment variable is set, ggman is ready to be used. 

### first steps

To validate that the configuration is correct, you can list all repositories that ggman detects.
To do this type:

```
ggman ls
```

If you want to find a specific installed repository you can provide a `--for` argument.
For example:

```
ggman --for https://github.com/tkw1536/ggman ls
```

will print the location of a particular repository.

To clone a new repository into the root directory, you can use the `ggman clone` command.
For example:

```
ggman clone https://github.com/tkw1536/ggman
```

This will clone the repository https://github.com/tkw1536/ggman to the folder `$GGROOT/github.com/tkw1536/ggman` using ssh keys. 

If you want to move all existing repositories into the standardized structure you can use:

```
ggman relocate
```

If you want to only see what would be moved where you can instead use

```
ggman relocate --simulate
```

A more thorough documentation on the commands above and how the URL to path mapping works can be found in the thorough documentation below. 

## the `ggman` command

The `ggman` command is implemented in golang and can be compiled using standard golang tools. 
In addition, a `Makefile` is provided. 

The command is split into several sub-commands, which are described below. 
`ggman` has the following general exit behavior:

| Exit Code          | Description                                                           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0                  | Everything went ok                                                    |
| 1                  | Command Parsing went ok, but a subcommand-specific error occurred     |
| 2                  | The user asked for an unknown subcommand                              |
| 3                  | Command-independent argument parsing failed, e.g. an invalid '--for'  |
| 4                  | Command-dependent argument parsing failed                             |
| 5                  | Invalid configuration                                                 |
| 6                  | Unable to parse a repository name                                     |


### 'ggman root' and 'ggman where'

It manages all git repositories inside a given root directory, and automatically sets up new repositories relative to the URLs they are cloned from. 
The root folder defaults to `~/Projects` but can be customized using the `$GGROOT` environment variable. 
The root directory can be echoed using the command `ggman root`. 

For example, when `ggman` clones a repository `https://github.com/hello/world.git`, this would automatically end up in `$GGROOT/github.com/hello/world`. 
This works not only for `github.com` urls, but for any kind of url. 
To see where a repository would be cloned to (but not actually cloning it), use `ggman where <REPO>`. 

### 'ggman ls'

While creating this folder structure when cloning new repositories, `ggman` can run operation on any other folder structure contained within the `GGROOT` directory. 
For this purpose the `ggman ls` command lists all repositories that have been found in this structure. 

For easier integration into scripts, `ggman ls` supports an `--exit-code` argument. 
If this is given, the command will return exit code 0 iff at least one repository is found, and exit code 1 otherwise. 

### the '--for' and '--here' arguments

When running multi-repository operations, it is possible to limit the operations to a specific subset of repositories. 
This is achieved by using the 'for' keyword along with a pattern. 
For example, `ggman --for 'github.com/*/example' ls` will list all repositories from `github.com` that are named `example`. 

Examples for supported patterns can be found in this table:

| Pattern            | Examples                                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `world`            | `git@github.com:hello/world.git`, `https://github.com/hello/world`  |*
| `hello/*`          | `git@github.com:hello/earth.git`, `git@github.com:hello/mars.git`   |
| `hello/m*`         | `git@github.com:hello/mars.git`, `git@github.com:hello/mercury.git` |
| `github.com/*/*`   | `git@github.com:hello/world.git`, `git@github.com:bye/world.git`    |
| `github.com/hello` | `git@github.com:hello/world.git`, `git@github.com:hello/mars.git`   |

Note that the `--for` argument also works for exact repository urls, e.g. `ggman --for 'https://github.com/tkw1536/GitManager' ls`. 
`--for` also works with absolute or relative filepaths to locally installed repositories. 

In addition to the `--for` argument, the `--here` argument also works.
It is a shortcut that is equivalent to calling `--for` with the remote of the repository located in the current working directory. 

In addition, the `--for` argument by default uses a fuzzy matching algorithm.
For example, the pattern `wrld` will also match a repository called `world`.
Fuzzy matching only works for patterns that do not contain a special glob characters (`*` and friends).
It is also possible to turn off fuzzy matching entirely by passing the `--no-fuzzy-filter` / `-n` argument.

### 'ggman comps' and 'ggman canon'

On `github.com` and multiple other providers, it is usually possible to clone repositories via multiple urls. 
For example, the repository `https://github.com/hello/world` can actually be cloned via:
- `https://github.com/hello/world.git` and
- `git@github.com:hello/world.git`

Usually the latter url is prefered over the former one in order to use SSH authentication instead of having to constantly having to type a password. 
For this purpose, ggman implements the concept of `canonical urls`, that is it treats the latter url as the main one and uses it to clone the repository. 
This behaviour can be customized by the user. 

A canonical url is generated from an original url using a so-called `CANSPEC` (canonical specification).
An example CANSPEC is `git@^:$.git`. 

CANSPECs generate canonical urls by first taking the original urls, and splitting them into path-like components. 
These components also perform some normalisation, such as removing common prefixes and suffixes. 
A few examples examples can be found in this table. 

| URL                            | Components                       |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `git@github.com/user/repo`     | `github.com`, `user`, `repo`     |
| `github.com/hello/world.git`   | `github.com`, `hello`, `world`   |
| `user@server.com:repo.git`     | `server.com`, `user`, `repo`     |

To see exactly which components a URL has, use `ggman comps <URL>`.

After this, the canonical url is generated by parsing each character of the CANSPEC.
By default, a character of the CANSPEC simply ends up in the canonical url. 
However, two characters are treated differently:
- `%` is replaced by the second unused component of the URI (commonly a username)
- `$` is replaced by all remaining components in the URI joined with a '/'. Also stops all special character processing afterwards. 
If `$` does not exist in the cspec, it is assumed to be at the end of the CANSPEC.

A couple of examples can be found below:

| CANSPEC           | Canonical URL of the components `server.com`, `user`, `repository` |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `git@^:$.git`     | `git@server.com:user/repository.git`                               |
| `ssh://%@^/$.git` | `ssh://user@server.com/repository.git`                             |
| (empty)           | `server.com/user/repository`                                       |

To get the canonical url of a repository use `ggman canon <URL> <CANSPEC>`. 

To customize the behaviour globally, a so-called `CANFILE` can be used. 
This `CANFILE` should either be called `.ggman` in the users home directory, or be pointed to by the `GGMAN_CANFILE` environment variable. 

A `CANFILE` should consist of several lines.
Each line should contain either one or two space-seperated strings. 
The first one is a pattern (as used with the `for` keyword) and the second is a CANSPEC to apply for all repositories matching this pattern. 
Empty lines and those starting with '#', '\\' are treated as comments. 

To resolve a canonical url with a CANFILE, simply omit the `CANSPEC` attribute of `ggman canon`. 

### 'ggman fix'

To fix an existing remote of a repository use `ggman fix`. 
This updates remotes of all matching repositories to their canonical form using the `CANFILE`. 
Optionally, you can pass a `--simulate` argument to `ggman fix`. 
Instead of storing any urls, it will only print what is being done to STDOUT. 

### 'ggman lsr'

To list the remotes of all installed repositories, use `ggman lsr`. 
It takes an optional argument `--canonical` which, if provided, cause ggman to print canonical urls instead of the provided ones. 

### 'ggman fetch' and 'ggman pull'

To fetch data for all repositories, or to run git pull, use `ggman fetch` and `ggman pull` respectively. 

### 'ggman clone', 'ggman link' and `ggman relocate`

To clone a new repoistory into the respective location, use `ggman clone` with the name of the repository as the argument, for example:

```bash
ggman clone git@github.com:hello/world.git
```

which will clone the the hello world repository into  `$GGROOT/github.com/hello/world`. 
This clonening not only works for the canonical repository url, but for any other url as well. 
For example:

```bash
ggman clone https://github.com/hello/world.git
```

will do the same as the above command. 

However sometimes for various reasons a repository needs to live in a non-standard location outside of `GGROOT`. 
For example, in the case of `go` packages these need to live within `$GOPATH`. 
In this case, it is sometimes useful to symlink these repositories into the existing directory structure. 
For this purpose, the `ggman link` command exists. 
This takes the path to the local clone of an existing repository, which will then be linked into the existing structure. 
For example

```bash
ggman link $HOME/go/src/github.com/hello/world
```

would link the repository in `$HOME/go/src/github.com/hello/world` into the right location. 
Here, this corresponds to `$GGROOT/github.com/hello/world`. 

Furthermore, sometimes a repository changes it's remote url and should be moved to the correct location. 
For this purpose the `ggman relocate` command can be used. 
It is called without arguments. 

### `ggman here`, `ggman web` and `ggman url`

```bash
ggman here
```
prints the current ggman-controlled repository. 
In addition, the command takes an optional `--tree` argument. 
When provided, also prints the location relative to the current git worktree root. 

Similarly, 

```bash
ggman web
```
attempts to open the url of the current repository in a web-browser. 
For this purpose it uses the CANSPEC `https://^/$`, which may not work with all git hosts. 
It also takes an optional `--tree`, which behaves similar and above and optionally opens a url pointing to the current folder. 

```bash
ggman url
```
is the same as `ggman web`, except that it only prints the URL to stdout. 

`ggman web` and `ggman url` also take an optional base url. 
If it is provided, the first component of the url is replace with the given base. 
ggman also supports a number of "default" base urls. 
For example:

```
ggman web travisci
```

will open the current repo on travis-ci.com. 
The following base urls are supported:

- `circle` - CircleCI
- `travis` - TravisCI

### 'ggman find-branch'

git 2.28 introduced the `init.defaultBranch` option to set the name of the default branch of new repositories. 
However this does not affect existing repositories. 

To find repositories with an old branch, the `ggman find-branch` command can be used. 
It takes a single argument (a branch name), and finds all repositories that contain a branch with the given name. 

### Useful aliases

In addition to ggman certain aliases can be very useful. 

```bash
# ggcd allows 'cd'-ing into a directory given a repository name
# e.g ggcd github.com/hello/world will cd into the directory where the
# 'github.com/hello/world' repository is checked out. 
ggcd () {
	ggman -f $1 ls --exit-code --one && cd $(ggman -f $1 ls --exit-code 2>&1)
}
# ggcode is like ggcd, except it opens an editor (here vscode) instead of cding. 
ggcode () {
	ggman -f $1 ls --exit-code && code $(ggman -f $1 ls --exit-code 2>&1)
}
```
